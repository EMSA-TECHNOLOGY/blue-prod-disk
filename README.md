# blue-prod-disk

A local disk adapter for the blue-prod framework and Waterline ORM.  Functions as a persistent object store which works great as a bundled, starter database (with the strict caveat that it is for non-production use only).  It is bundled with the `blue-prod-hook-orm` hook that is included by default in new blue-prod projects.

> Under the hood, this uses [nedb](http://npmjs.com/package/nedb).
